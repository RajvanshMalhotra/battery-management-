Battery Management System with Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries using a Random Forest model. The machine learning code processes sensor data (e.g., temperature, discharge rate, and current) to provide actionable insights for optimizing battery performance and predicting degradation.

Features
Predicts Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on input parameters.
Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for robust predictions.
Processes sensor data to simulate real-world battery management scenarios.
Project Workflow
